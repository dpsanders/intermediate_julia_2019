# Intermediate Julia workshop

## JuliaCon 2019, Baltimore, Maryland, USA

### Monday 22 July 2019

These are Jupyter notebooks for the intermediate Julia workshop at JuliaCon 2019.
They consist of a series of exercises that the reader should implement while reading the text and/or following the video.

The notebooks may be viewed (but not edited) online at [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dpsanders/intermediate_julia_2019/tree/master).

The [`live`](live) folder contains copies of the notebooks from the workshop, including solutions to most of the exercises, although they are a bit messy.

The video recording of the workshop was unfortunately unusable.
